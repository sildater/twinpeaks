      <p>Hi there!</p>
      <p> This page is a visual interface for the modulation matrix of the 
        <a href="https://novationmusic.com/en/synths/summit">Novation Summit</a>
        
        and <a href="https://novationmusic.com/en/synths/peak">Peak</a>.
        To start MIDI in the browser click anywhere.
        Browsers like Opera, Edge and Chrome support MIDI.</p>

        <p>
        Choose your synth's MIDI port in dropdown menu in the lower rigth corner.
        Use the lower dropdown menu to change the MIDI channel.
        Click on a Mod Slot in the colored column on the right to activate this slot.
        To the right of the Mod Slots you see their Depth parameters, click and drag horizontally to change the values.

      </p>
      <p>
        Click somewhere in the main matrix to change the source (listed on the left) and destination (listed on top) of currently selected mod slot.
        Directly to the left of the mod slot you find the secondary sources, click one to activate it for the currently selected mod slot.
      </p>
        
      <p>
        If you open the "mod" menu on your instrument you can see the changes made.
        It's not yet possible to load a mod matrix state from the instrument or download a state, this page always starts with blank slate.
        Save your creation on your Summit/Peak!
      </p>
